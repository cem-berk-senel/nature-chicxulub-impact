Python and Matlab codes to plot the data of figures in the Nature Geoscience Chicxulub manuscript. 

The paleoclimate general circulation model (GCM) output data needed in these Python and Matlab codes are publicly available in the OSF repository, via https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6YM3J

Any question on shared codes can be emailed to the following address: cem.berk@observatory.be

Note that all the codes use SI units (kg/m/s/K).
